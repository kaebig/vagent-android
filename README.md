## Product Description

Vagent is a mobile application that provides a natural voice interface for interacting with your custom AI agents. Chatting with personal AI agents can be frustrating, especially when typing on a mobile device. The most natural way to interact is through your voice.

### Key Features

- **Natural Voice Interface**: Interact with your AI agents through voice commands
- **Simple Integration**: Requires only a single webhook to integrate with your custom AI agents (built with n8n, for example)
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes visual animations that provide feedback during interaction
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available for Android and iOS devices
- **Customizable**: Configure the app to work with different AI agents according to your needs

### How It Works

1. **Voice Recording**: Press the microphone button and speak your query
2. **Text Conversion**: Your voice is converted to text using speech recognition technology
3. **AI Processing**: The text is sent to your custom AI agent through a webhook
4. **Audible Response**: The agent's response is played back in audio with synchronized visual effects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Android Issues
